# The Pet Hub 

The Pet Hub site is an ecommerce site for pet owners supplying  essential and non-essential pet items.  The site provides a platform for local pet services to advertise and promote their services to website visitors and it has a  blog featuring articles by  local  dog and cat service owners Eg dog-daycare, owners, local vets, local kennel and cattery service owners, dog groomers ,dog walkers etc.
Revenue  to the website owner can be earned through commission on items sold and from selling advertising space.  

The blog is a vital part of the ecommerce site because it  can generate traffic and customers. To achieve organic ranking and get traffic for a website is often difficult, slow and costly. A blog is an excellent way to cut advertising costs and boost the ranking of an online store quickly in a way that search engines approve. 
Blog posts allow the use of  relevant, search engine optimized keywords inserted as slugs in the blog title.
Blog articles can feature and review products in the store, and can link to those items.
Product descriptions for items in an ecommerce store have to be short and specific, a blog article can can use targeted keywords and lengthy descriptions. Carefully written posts are indexed by  search engines and will rank in the organic search results and generate traffic to the site with no advertising costs.

Blog posts featuring products for sale can also be posted on social media  platforms for free advertising to generate traffic and customers by means of backlinks to the product item.
Blogging allows the business owner to write tips, user guides, comparison articles, etc. These articles can  create  more traffic and more interest without "hard selling"  and can demonstrate the strengths of store products compared to those of competitors. 

The regular addition of blog articles creates fresh content for the site, as do the  comments added by  blog readers. Search engines consider fresh content addition to a site as positive ranking feature. 
Shoppers may buy items from the website without creating an account but visitors are encouraged to register and create an account so they can store their shipping and purchasing information and so that the website can market to them through email. 

**Rationale for the Project** 
 The pet sector is flourishing and pet owners like to buy the latest pet gadgets and gear and are interested in pet items that are useful and fun. Django and Stripe technologies can create a very effective website that can be commercially viable and not difficult or time consuming to operate. I want  to develop this project and make it a reality.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

### Steps to Heroku Deployment :

 **Setting up the Heroku App** 

1. Go to Heroku.com and click on New and then create new app 
2. Name app and choose region. 
3. Use the Resources tab and provision a new Postgres database ( instead of Sqlite ) 

 To use Postgres as the database 2  installations are required in gitpod 
    dj_database_url   Use pip3 install dj_database_url     
    psycopg2-binary    Use pip3 install psycopg2-binary  

Now freeze the requirements.txt using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt ( this ensures Heroku installs all app requirements when the app is deployed) 

4. In settings.py  import dj_database_url 
5.  In settings.py under the databases setting add the database URL from Heroku – which is found in the config variables in the Heroku app settings tab ( or from the command line using Heroku config) 
6. Run the migrations command  to apply all the migrations and set up the database using
    python3 manage.py makemigrations –dry-run
    python 3 manage.py makemigrations 
    python 3 manage.py migrate --plan 
    python3 manage.py migrate

7. The data must now be imported by loading product data, category data and blog data 
8.  Create a superuser pw and username to log in with Using python3 manage.py createsuperuser
9. Remove the Heroku database config. and uncomment the original so the database URL doesn't end up in version control
10. Commit all changes and push to git hub 
11.  Import the categories data using python3 manage.py loaddata categories 
     and then the products using python3 manage.py loaddata products 
12.  Create a superuser username and pw to login  with python3 manage.py createsuperuser
13.  Remove the Heroku database configuration and restore ( uncommit ) the original setting so the database URL does not end up in version control. 
14. Commit the changes and push to git hub 

<u>Setting up alternative database URL environments</u>

Create an if statement in settings.py so that when the app is running on Heroku the database URL environment variable will be defined the connection is with Postgres and otherwise we connect to SQLite.  If the database URL is in os.environ we will generate its value using dj_database_url.parse and use that as the database setting – otherwise the default configuration will be used

![image-20210208181619997](C:\Users\Maria\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210208181619997.png)

15.Requirements to be  installed before final deployment to Heroku

 Add gunicorn   use the command pip3 install gunicorn 
 Add into the requirements.txt file using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
 Add a Procfile  ( this tells Heroku to create a web dyno that will run both gunicorn and serve the Django app 

16.Ensure that you are logged into Heroku.com 

17.Temporarily disable collectstatic using the command  
Heroku config set disable collectstatic = 1 - - app (add host name of Heroku app here ) 

18 In settings.py add the hostname of Heroku app to allowed hosts AND add localhost so gitpod will still work

19.Now attempt deployment by adding and committing these changes and push to git hub
 Then deploy to Heroku  using       git push Heroku master

NB if this triggers an error message then you may have to initialize your Heroku git remote if the app was created on the website rather than in the CLI 

Use the command Heroku git:remote -a  app-name-here  
 then git push Heroku master 

## Steps to Run App Locally 

**Requirements** 
An IDE  ( gitpod, VSCode, PyCharm)

PIP  to install packages such as Django , Pillow etc. 
Python3 

Git  for easy version control 

**Access the github repository.** Download or Clone 

Download a zip file.

- On the GitHub project page, click ‘code’ tab  to download a zip file.
- Extract the files to a  folder on the desktop.

Clone the repository 

1.  On the GitHub project pag click to copy the url for your repository.
2. Either open Git Bash on your local computer or open the command line on your IDE and     ensure you are in the right directory. Then run the following command:

git clone  https://github.com/mr19331/the-pet-hub.git        Select a file destination for the directory

Ensure you have pip installed on the machine:  py -3 -m pip --version

Use a virtual environment for the Python interpreter. Python's  built-in environment can can be used with the command  : python -m .venv <path for venv>

Activate the environment  using the command:  .venv\Scripts\activate

Download the requirements for the project using the command:   pip -r requirements.txt

Set up the environment variables in an env.py file 

- SECRET_KEY
- DATABASE_URL*
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
- EMAIL_HOST_USER
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
- STRIPE_WH_SECRET

EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD  Can be found in the security settings of your email host.

The EMAIL_HOST_USER is  the email address from which you want your emails to be sent from.

Before you can start the local server,  apply all the migrations and set up the database using
python3 manage.py makemigrations –dry-run
python 3 manage.py makemigrations 
python 3 manage.py migrate --plan 
python3 manage.py migrate

This will create a database of all of your models. Use the following code for each fixture in the project,  to “fill” the databases.

python3 manage.py loaddata <fixturename.json>

Once the data is loaded you can then run your server locally.    python3 manage.py runserver 

This will open a port (which may be different depending on your IDE) .
